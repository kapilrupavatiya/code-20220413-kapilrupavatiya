Notes:
1. Input file name needs to gives in constants.py file.
2. Ideally input file needs to be in same folder where file present.
3. Run python script (bmi_calculator) from folder only.
4. Once execution completed it will create 2 file, first will be contain data with BMI, BMI Category and Health risk (Name of this file is input file name + _output.json), Second will be summery of BMI category (Name of this file is input file name + _bmi_category_summery.json), It will saw count per BMI category.
5. Due to time constrains, I am not able to add all test cases, I just give idea in test file how can we write deeply test cases which will cover all corner cases.
